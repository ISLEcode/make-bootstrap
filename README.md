# make-bootstrap

Here is a _good old_ `Makefile` to download, configure and build [Bootstrap][https://getbootstrap.com].
For us the old-timers who have a hard time reinventing the wheel with the _gulps_ and _grunts_ of the Javascript world :smile:

Getting your distribution ready is as simple as:

``` {.sh}
make init
make dist
```

Enjoy!
