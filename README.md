# BSTemplate

A skeleton repository to build Bootstrap-based web designs using essentially the same toolchain as that used by the Bootstrap
team, with one exception: we use conventional `make(1)` to perform the builds.

Check [releases](https://github.com/ISLEcode/www-bstemplate/releases) for available downloads. There are separate branches for
Bootstrap [version 4](https://github.com/ISLEcode/www-bstemplate/tree/bootstrap-v4) and [version
5](https://github.com/ISLEcode/www-bstemplate/tree/bootstrap-v5).
